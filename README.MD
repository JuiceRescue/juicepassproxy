# JuicePass Proxy

This tool will publish JuiceBox data by using a Man in the Middle UDP proxy to MQTT that is auto-discoverable by HomeAssistant. The `Enel X Way` app will continue to function.

It can also publish the IP of the proxy to the JuiceBox directly to avoid using custom local DNS servers using the `update_udpc` and `juicebox_host` command line parameters.

Builds upon work by lovely folks in this issue: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/86588

_Hopefully we won't need this if EnelX fixes their API!_

#### It is required that both your JuiceBox and the machine you are running `juicepassproxy` on have internal, static IPs on your intranet.

## Docker Compose Installation

### Features
*  If `JUICEBOX_HOST` is defined, it will run a telnet script to get the EnelX Server and Port as well as the JuiceBox ID.

*  If `ENELX_IP` is not defined, it will use the CloudFlare DNS (1.1.1.1) to get the IP address of the EnelX Server and avoid a DNS lookup loop.

*  If `LOCAL_IP` is not defined, it will lookup the Local IP address of the Docker.

* If `UPDATE_UDPC` is true, JuicePass Proxy will continually update the JuiceBox via telnet to send its data to JuicePass Proxy. Use this if you are not able to change your DNS to route the JuiceBox traffic to JuicePass Proxy.

### Instructions

1. Pick One Option:

    A. Configure your DNS server running on your network (like Pi-hole or your router) to route all UDP traffic from your JuiceBox to the machine running this proxy. Instructions for how to do this will vary by router. See [Getting EnelX Server IPs](#getting-enelx-server-ips) for instructions on what EnelX Server you need to override.

    B. Set these Docker Environment Variables in your Docker Compose file:</br>
      ```
      UPDATE_UDPC=true
      JUICEBOX_HOST=<IP address of your JuiceBox>
      JPP_HOST=<IP address of the machine that the JuicePass Proxy Docker Container is running on>
      ```

1. Add the `juicepassproxy` container to your Docker Compose file.

    A.  Set `ports:` to the port listed in the UDCP line, likely `8047` _(see [Getting EnelX Server IPs](#getting-enelx-server-ips))_.

    B. Define the applicable environment variables _(see [Docker Environment Variables](#docker-environment-variables))_.

    C. Specify the location for the config and optionally the logs folder

1. Start the Docker container.

**IGNORE_REMOTE**  | No  | Default: false. If true, will not send commands received from EnelX to the JuiceBox nor send outgoing information from the JuiceBox to EnelX
**TELNET_TIMEOUT**  | No  | Default: 30. Timeout in seconds for telnet operations.
**JUICEBOX_ID**  | No | If not defined, will attempt to get the JuiceBox ID using telnet.
**LOCAL_IP**<br><br>_Deprecated Variable: SRC_ | No | If not defined, will attempt to get the Local Docker IP. Can optionally define port (ex. 127.0.0.1:8047). If unsuccessful, will default to 127.0.0.1.
**LOCAL_PORT** | No | Local port for JuicePass Proxy to listen on. If not defined, will use the EnelX Port.
**ENELX_IP**<br><br>_Deprecated Variable: DST_ | No | If not defined, will attempt to get the IP of the EnelX Server. If unsuccessful, will default to 54.161.185.130.

<summary><h2>Manual Installation</h2></summary>

1. Clone this repository
2. Use Python 3.10+ (I recommend setting up a virtual environment)
3. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch by executing `python3 juicepassproxy.py --juicebox_host <IP of the JuiceBox> --mqtt_host <mqtt_host>` (params documented below)
5. Nothing happens!
6. Configure your DNS server running on your network (like Pi-hole or your router) to route all DNS requests from EnelX to the machine running this proxy. For me this was `juicenet-udp-prod3-usa.enelx.com`. See below for instructions to determine that.
7. Alternatively to #6, you can enable `--update_udpc` on the command line and set `--juicebox_host` and the application will force publish the IP in the `--local_ip` argument to the JuiceBox and avoid the need to set DNS rules on your router or DNS server. **NOTE: if you need to publish a different IP than the one in the `--local_ip` argument, you can make use of the `--jpp_host` arg.**

_For `--enelx_ip`, only use the IP address of the EnelX Server and **not** the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to avoid DNS lookup loops._

#### Deprecated Environment Variables and Command Line options will continue to work for now but will be removed at some point in the future.

## Getting EnelX Server IPs

To get the destination IP:Port of the EnelX server, telnet into your JuiceBox device:
`$ telnet 192.168.x.x 2000`
and type the `list` command:

```
list
! # Type  Info
# 0 FILE  webapp/index.html-1.4.0.24 (1995, 0)
# 1 UDPC  juicenet-udp-prod3-usa.enelx.com:8047 (26674)
```

The address is in the `UDPC` line. Run, `ping`, `nslookup`, or similar command to determine the IP.

As of November, 2023: `juicenet-udp-prod3-usa.enelx.com` = `54.161.185.130`.
