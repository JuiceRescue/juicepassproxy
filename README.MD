# JuicePass Proxy

This tool will publish JuiceBox data by using a Man in the Middle UDP proxy to MQTT that is auto-discoverable by HomeAssistant. The `Enel X Way` app will continue to function.

It can also publish the IP of the proxy to the JuiceBox directly to avoid using custom local DNS servers using the `update_udpc` and `juicebox_host` command line parameters.

Builds upon work by lovely folks in this issue: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/86588

_Hopefully we won't need this if EnelX fixes their API!_

#### It is required that both your JuiceBox and the machine you are running `juicepassproxy` on have internal, static IPs on your intranet.

## Docker Compose Installation

### Features
*  If `JUICEBOX_HOST` is defined, it will run a telnet script to get the EnelX Server and Port as well as the JuiceBox ID.

*  If `ENELX_IP` is not defined, it will use the CloudFlare DNS (1.1.1.1) to get the IP address of the EnelX Server and avoid a DNS lookup loop.

*  If `LOCAL_IP` is not defined, it will lookup the Local IP address of the Docker.

* If `UPDATE_UDPC` is true, JuicePass Proxy will continually update the JuiceBox via telnet to send its data to JuicePass Proxy. Use this if you are not able to change your DNS to route the JuiceBox traffic to JuicePass Proxy.

### Instructions

1. Pick One Option:

    A. Configure your DNS server running on your network (like Pi-hole or your router) to route all UDP traffic from your JuiceBox to the machine running this proxy. Instructions for how to do this will vary by router. See [Getting EnelX Server IPs](#getting-enelx-server-ips) for instructions on what EnelX Server you need to override.

    B. Set these Docker Environment Variables in your Docker Compose file:</br>

      ```
      UPDATE_UDPC=true
      JUICEBOX_HOST=<IP address of your JuiceBox>
      JPP_HOST=<IP address of the machine that the JuicePass Proxy Docker Container is running on>
      ```

    C. Use your router to redirect traffic from JuiceBox to JuicePass Proxy

      *  Check the port that your JuiceBox is using to communicate. See [Getting EnelX Server IPs](#getting-enelx-server-ips)

      *  Create a redirect rule on your router redirect UDP traffic coming from JuiceBox to the IP:PORT where you are running JuicePass Proxy

      *  Create a masquerade rule on router to masquerade the traffic that goes to JuicePass Proxy IP:PORT (hairpin nat)

      *  Depending of your forward rules, you may need to create an extra rule to allow that forwarding traffic

      *  Sample MikroTik rules for reference (10.1.12.230 = JuiceBox, 10.1.0.22 = JuicePass Proxy)</br>

      ```
      add action=dst-nat chain=dstnat comment=juicebox dst-port=8042 protocol=udp src-address=10.1.12.230 to-addresses=10.1.0.22 to-ports=8042
      #
      add action=masquerade chain=srcnat comment=juicebox dst-address=10.1.0.22 dst-port=8042 protocol=udp src-address=10.1.12.230
      ```

1. Add the `juicepassproxy` container to your Docker Compose file.

    A.  Set `ports:` to the port listed in the UDCP line, likely `8047` _(see [Getting EnelX Server IPs](#getting-enelx-server-ips))_.

    B. Define the applicable environment variables _(see [Docker Environment Variables](#docker-environment-variables))_.

    C. Specify the location for the config and optionally the logs folder

1. Start the Docker container.

<summary><h2>Manual Installation</h2></summary>

1. Clone this repository
2. Use Python 3.10+ (I recommend setting up a virtual environment)
3. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch by executing `python3 juicepassproxy.py --juicebox_host <IP of the JuiceBox> --mqtt_host <mqtt_host>` (params documented below)
5. Nothing happens!
6. Configure your DNS server running on your network (like Pi-hole or your router) to route all DNS requests from EnelX to the machine running this proxy. For me this was `juicenet-udp-prod3-usa.enelx.com`. See below for instructions to determine that.
7. Alternatively to #6, you can enable `--update_udpc` on the command line and set `--juicebox_host` and the application will force publish the IP in the `--local_ip` argument to the JuiceBox and avoid the need to set DNS rules on your router or DNS server. **NOTE: if you need to publish a different IP than the one in the `--local_ip` argument, you can make use of the `--jpp_host` arg.**

</details>

#### Deprecated Environment Variables and Command Line options will continue to work for now but will be removed at some point in the future.

## Getting EnelX Server IPs

To get the destination IP:Port of the EnelX server, telnet into your JuiceBox device and use the [list](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-os/4/standard/4.2/cmd/commands#stream-list) command:
`$ telnet 192.168.x.x 2000`
and type the `list` command:

```
list
! # Type  Info
# 0 FILE  webapp/index.html-1.4.0.24 (1995, 0)
# 1 UDPC  juicenet-udp-prod3-usa.enelx.com:8047 (26674)
```

The address is in the `UDPC` line. Run, `ping`, `nslookup`, or similar command to determine the IP.  The following [network_lookup](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-os/4/standard/4.2/cmd/commands#network-lookup) command can be run in JuiceBox telnet to look it up while still connected:
```
network_lookup juicenet-udp-prod3-usa.enelx.com
54.161.185.130
network_lookup jvb1.emotorwerks.com
158.47.1.128
```

As of November, 2023: `juicenet-udp-prod3-usa.enelx.com` = `54.161.185.130`.

## Important information
- This proxy is made using effort from owners that found information and made packet capture to reverse enginner the protocol used by the devices
- There are many different firmware versions found
    - some accept telnet, some others not 
- Different protocol versions are found
- We cannot assure that this will work will all versions
- If this does not work with your device you must provide :
    - logs (and if possible packet captures) with messages that are send to/from your device
    - docker enviroment configuration used or juicepassproxy command line parameters
    - if your device still works with ENELX servers but not with juicepass :
        - a packet capture will provide usefull information to understand what are the differences that are not being considered yet
- Sometimes it takes a while to stabilize, if you are changing between ENEL X and JPP let it running for some minutes before testing

## juicepassproxy important behaviours to understand
- For devices that uses the protocol version v07 the juicepassproxy will only start talking with device after 6 minutes to make sure it gets the correct offline current in the device.
- when defining the MQTT entities that are show on homeassistant  juicepassproxy will define a max_current value, on the first time it starts it will use 48A for this value, after receiving the device rating the value will be stored on configuration and at next start will be used as maximum to allow the correct range on homeassistant

## Controlling Charging current

- **Max Current (Offline/Wanted)**
   - Control maximum current that device will charge when offline (not connected to juicebox or Enel X)
      - 2024-06 tested on device which send protocol v09u it changes **Max Charging Current** to this value around 5 minutes after not receiving messages from proxy
   - Stored on EEPROM - https://github.com/snicker/juicepassproxy/issues/39#issuecomment-2002312548
      - Because of this **don't change that value many times**, as any EEPROM has a lifespan based on writes and the *Max Charging Current* will make possible to control the Current for Charging

- **Max Current (Offline/Device)**
   - The value that are sent from the juicebox device indicating what will the offline charge current

- **Max Current (Online/Wanted)**
   - Control the Current that Juicebox provides to the vehicle when connected to server
   - Can be used for example to control charging based on Solar Power generation
      - As suggestion check for changes at 3-5 minutes intervals
         - this give time for stabilizations on charging and energy generation
         - this interval was tested with old ENEL X API integration and now with juicepassproxy responding to juicebox
   - Putting 0 pauses the charging
      - Pausing will reset the session energy value
      - This may affect the lifespan of internal contactor if paused/restarted too many times
   - Some cars can have different behaviours
     - Bolt 2022 (Brazil) checks the Current at connection 
         - if the value is less equal than 10 A it will consider that is using a portable charger and cannot accept Current changes greater than 10A later
         - if the value is 0 A (Pause), it will show a charging error on dashboard but will start charging when value goes to 6A or over
     
- **Max Current (Online/Device)**
   - The value that are sent from the juicebox device indicating what is the online charge current


- Warning about offline / online
   - Apparently some devices consider offline as a maximum that can be used on device, and even if you put online over that it will consider the minimum value
       - https://github.com/JuiceRescue/juicepassproxy/pull/69#issuecomment-2408423204
   - Tests on one JB 2.x / v09u indicates that the online value can be over the offline value for charging
      - This will allow safe usage of load-balancing logic from a server and use lower values for safety
      - If you have one of this devices and have limited circuit you must respect your circuit limits when changing the online value

## Energy
- **Energy Session**
   - the Juicebox device reset this value when car changes from **Charging** to **Plugged In** State

## Multiple JuiceBoxes
- Multiple instances of JPP must be executed, one per JuiceBox.
    - Each JPP instance should specify the following parameters in addition to the basic parameters.
        - **--name** - each should use a different name, because this is the identifier of MQTT topic
        - **--juicebox_id** - defining this disable the telnet and will start faster, must be the correct serial of each device
        - **--local_port** - each needs to use their own port but make sure the UDP 8042 redirection rule matches the destination port
        - **--config_loc** - each needs their own directory
    - Future versions can be able to work with multiple devices : https://github.com/JuiceRescue/juicepassproxy/issues/102


## Configuration file
- You can configure initial state of mqtt entities :
    - **ENTITY_initial_state** or **SERIAL_ENTITY_initial_state**
    - **current_max_offline_set_initial_state** can be used for device that does not send current_max_offline value on status messages (v07 protocol) and do faster startup
    
## Upgrading from older versions if you have any problem with wrong entities on Homeassistant
- Stop juicepassproxy
- Remove old configuration on MQTT, using mosquitto_sub or any other MQTT client
    - **mosquitto_sub -t "homeassistant/+/JuiceBox/+/config" -v --remove-retained**
- Remove Juicebox device on Homeassistant
- Start juicepassproxy
